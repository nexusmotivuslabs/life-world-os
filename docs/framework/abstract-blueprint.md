# Abstract Blueprint

The 7 Games Framework and Root System

## Overview

Life operates simultaneously across multiple interlocking games. Each game has its own currency, rules, and failure modes. Most people optimize for one game and play the others badly.

The root system underneath all games is **Consciousness and Choice** - the meta-skill of awareness and intentional game-switching.

## The 7 Games

### 1. The Power Game

**Currency:** Money, assets, leverage, status

**Question it answers:** What can I influence or control?

**Failure mode:** Greed, fear, domination, emptiness

Money lives here.

**In Life World OS:**
- Gold resource
- Engines stat
- Investment system
- Engines (Career, Business, Investment)

### 2. The Survival Game

**Currency:** Safety, health, shelter, routines

**Question it answers:** Will I be okay tomorrow?

**Failure mode:** Anxiety, hoarding, risk avoidance

Money helps here, but health and environment matter more.

**In Life World OS:**
- Oxygen resource (financial safety net)
- Capacity stat (health, energy, resilience)
- Water resource (health score)
- Armor resource (systems, buffers, boundaries)

### 3. The Energy Game

**Currency:** Vitality, sleep, nutrition, emotional regulation

**Question it answers:** Do I have the energy to engage with life?

**Failure mode:** Burnout, addiction, depression

Money barely touches this once basics are met.

**In Life World OS:**
- Energy resource (daily budget)
- Capacity stat (governs energy regeneration)
- Exercise actions
- Burnout failure state

### 4. The Meaning Game

**Currency:** Purpose, values, contribution, faith

**Question it answers:** Why am I alive?

**Failure mode:** Nihilism, spiritual bypassing, false missions

Money does almost nothing here directly.

**In Life World OS:**
- Meaning stat
- Value-aligned actions
- Meaning decay when actions drift from values
- Burnout resistance from high Meaning

### 5. The Relationship Game

**Currency:** Trust, love, respect, shared history

**Question it answers:** Who walks with me?

**Failure mode:** Transactional bonds, loneliness, power imbalance

Money can damage this if misunderstood.

**In Life World OS:**
- Not yet explicitly modeled
- Implied through Meaning stat (values alignment)
- Future expansion area

### 6. The Mastery Game

**Currency:** Skill, competence, progress, craft

**Question it answers:** What can I do well?

**Failure mode:** Ego, stagnation, comparison

Money may reward mastery but does not create it.

**In Life World OS:**
- Learning Engine
- Learning actions
- XP system (progression)
- Optionality stat (skills create options)

### 7. The Time Game

**Currency:** Attention, presence, freedom of schedule

**Question it answers:** How do my days actually feel?

**Failure mode:** Busyness, distraction, regret

Money can buy time only if wisely used.

**In Life World OS:**
- Time ticks (Daily, Weekly, Seasonal)
- Energy budget (forces attention to what matters)
- Seasonal cycles (enforce rest periods)
- Optionality stat (freedom of schedule)

## The Root System: Consciousness and Choice

Under all games is the root layer.

**This is not money.**
**This is not meaning.**

The root is:

### Consciousness and Choice

The ability to:

1. **Notice** which game you are in
2. **Choose** when to play or not play
3. **Switch** games intentionally
4. **Accept** tradeoffs consciously

This is the meta skill.

Without awareness, you are dragged between games unconsciously.
With awareness, you become the architect.

## How Games Interrelate

### Tensions

- Optimizing Power (money) can drain Energy (burnout)
- Optimizing Survival (safety) can limit Optionality (hoarding)
- Optimizing Meaning (purpose) can reduce Power (less income)
- Optimizing Energy (rest) can slow Mastery (less practice)

### Synergies

- High Energy enables better Power Game play
- High Meaning protects against Energy Game failure (burnout resistance)
- High Mastery increases Optionality
- High Optionality reduces Survival Game stress

### The Meta-Game

The game is choosing which game to play, when, and how much.

This requires consciousness.

## Meta-Game Mechanics in Life World OS

### Awareness Actions

- Reflection activities that reveal which game you're optimizing
- Journaling that tracks game-switching
- Reviews that assess balance across games

### Choice Mechanics

- Seasonal system forces intentional game-switching
- Over-optimization penalties punish single-game focus
- Balance indicators show which games are neglected

### Sidequests for Growth

**Consciousness sidequests:**
- "Which game am I playing?" reflection
- "What am I not doing?" awareness exercises
- "What tradeoff did I just make?" tracking

**Choice sidequests:**
- "Switch games intentionally" challenges
- "Accept a tradeoff consciously" exercises
- "Play multiple games this week" goals

## Integration Points

### Current Implementation

Life World OS currently models:
- Power Game (Engines, Gold, Investments)
- Survival Game (Oxygen, Capacity, Water, Armor)
- Energy Game (Energy resource, Capacity stat)
- Meaning Game (Meaning stat)
- Mastery Game (Learning, XP, Optionality)
- Time Game (Seasons, Ticks, Energy budget)

### Missing Explicitly

- Relationship Game (implicit in Meaning)
- Consciousness/Choice mechanics (meta-game not yet implemented)

### Future Expansion

- Explicit Relationship Game mechanics
- Consciousness tracking (awareness level)
- Choice history (game-switching decisions)
- Sidequest system for consciousness growth

## Design Principle

The system must make players aware they are playing multiple games.

It must punish single-game optimization.

It must reward conscious game-switching.

The meta-game is the most important game.
