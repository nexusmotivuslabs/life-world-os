# MONEY

Life World OS Game Manual

## Overview

Money (Gold resource) is the currency of the Power Game. It enables influence, control, and the expansion of options. However, it has strict limitations that cannot be bypassed.

---

## What Money Can Do

### Remove Fear

- High Gold reduces financial stress
- Enables risk-taking when combined with Oxygen (savings)
- Provides security buffer

### Expand Options

- Unlocks higher-value actions
- Enables investments
- Increases Optionality stat

### Reduce Friction

- Simplifies decision-making (less resource scarcity)
- Enables faster progression
- Reduces daily survival pressure

---

## What Money Cannot Do

### Give Meaning

- Money cannot create purpose
- Meaning stat is separate from Gold
- High Gold with low Meaning still results in decay

### Heal Relationships

- Relationships require separate investment
- Transactional approaches damage relationships
- Money can harm relationships if misunderstood

### Create Discipline

- Discipline comes from Capacity and Meaning
- Money can enable bad habits
- Self-control is independent of wealth

### Generate Wisdom

- Wisdom requires experience and reflection
- Money does not teach judgment
- Poor decisions can happen at any wealth level

### Provide Identity

- Identity comes from Meaning and values
- Money cannot replace self-knowledge
- Wealth does not equal worth

## Attributes

### Sources

1. **Engines**
   - Career Engine (salary)
   - Business Engine (entrepreneurship)
   - Investment Engine (returns)
   - Learning Engine (skills → income)

2. **Investments**
   - Assets generate returns
   - Compounds over time
   - Requires initial Gold investment

3. **Gifts/Luck**
   - One-time windfalls
   - Not sustainable
   - Cannot be relied upon

### Methods to Gain

- Work Project actions (generate Gold)
- Active Engines produce monthly income
- Investment returns (compound)
- Selling assets (one-time)

### Methods to Lose

- Expenses (daily costs)
- Taxes (system deductions)
- Poor investment decisions
- Emergency spending

### Optionality

- High Gold unlocks higher-risk actions
- Enables major bets (when combined with Oxygen)
- Increases strategic flexibility
- Reduces failure state penalties

---

## Rule Interactions

### With Engines Stat

- High Engines stat increases Gold generation rate
- Engines stat unlocks higher-value income sources
- Low Engines restricts Gold-earning actions

### With Oxygen Resource

- Gold can convert to Oxygen (savings)
- High Gold + high Oxygen enables major bets
- Gold alone is not enough for stability

### With Optionality Stat

- Gold increases Optionality (more options available)
- High Gold unlocks higher-risk actions
- Low Gold restricts available choices

### With Failure States

- High Gold reduces Financial Stress severity
- Gold cannot prevent Burnout (that's Capacity)
- Gold cannot prevent Stagnation (that's action diversity)

---

## Strategic Notes

### Optimal Use

- Convert excess Gold to Oxygen (financial safety net)
- Invest in Engines (compound returns)
- Use Gold to unlock Optionality-boosting actions
- Maintain balance with other resources

### Pitfalls

- Hoarding Gold reduces Meaning (over-optimization penalty)
- Relying only on Gold neglects other games
- Gold without Oxygen is fragile
- Gold cannot replace Capacity or Meaning

### Tradeoffs

- More Work (for Gold) reduces Capacity
- Saving excessively reduces Meaning
- High Gold focus neglects other stats
- Power Game optimization has Energy Game costs

---

## Design Intent

Money is powerful but limited.

It solves specific problems but not all problems.

The system punishes single-game optimization (Power Game only).

Balance across games is required.

Money is a tool, not a goal.
