# OXYGEN

Life World OS Game Manual

## Overview

Oxygen (the resource, not the stat) represents months of expenses covered - your financial safety net. It is the currency of the Survival Game. Oxygen decays daily if not maintained, creating constant pressure.

## What Oxygen Can Do

### Financial Stability

- High Oxygen reduces stress
- Enables confident decision-making
- Provides security buffer

### Reduce Stress

- Low Oxygen creates stress events
- High Oxygen eliminates stress penalties
- Reduces failure state risk

### Enable Risk-Taking

- High Oxygen allows major bets
- Enables season transitions
- Unlocks high-risk actions
- Combined with Gold, creates Optionality

---

## What Oxygen Cannot Do

### Buy Time Directly

- Time is separate (Time Game)
- Oxygen doesn't add hours to the day
- Energy is still limited

### Replace Meaning

- Oxygen is survival, not purpose
- Meaning stat is independent
- High Oxygen with low Meaning still decays

### Prevent Decay

- Oxygen decays daily (0.1 months per day if no Engines)
- Requires active maintenance
- Cannot be set and forgotten

## Attributes

### Sources

1. **Active Engines**
   - Engines generate Oxygen monthly
   - 1 Engine offsets 0.05 months decay
   - Multiple Engines provide surplus

2. **Savings Actions**
   - Save Expenses actions increase Oxygen
   - Direct conversion from Gold to Oxygen
   - Primary manual method

3. **Investments**
   - Investment returns can increase Oxygen
   - Compound over time
   - Long-term growth

### Methods to Gain

- Active Engines (monthly generation)
- Save Expenses actions (direct increase)
- Investment returns (compound growth)
- Reducing expenses (indirect)

### Methods to Lose

- Daily decay (0.1 months per day baseline)
- Expenses (monthly costs)
- Emergencies (unexpected costs)
- Poor decisions (wasteful spending)

### Decay

- **Daily decay:** 0.1 months per day (if no active Engines)
- **Decay offset:** Each active Engine offsets 0.05 months
- **Minimum:** Cannot go below 0
- **No maximum:** Can accumulate indefinitely

## Rule Interactions

### With Engines

- Active Engines offset decay
- More Engines = slower decay or surplus
- No Engines = maximum decay rate
- Engines are primary maintenance method

### With Failure States

- Low Oxygen (<0.5 months) triggers Financial Stress
- Financial Stress creates random penalties
- Prevents major bets
- Reduces Meaning stat

### With Major Bets

- Requires Oxygen >3 months (rule)
- High Oxygen enables risk-taking
- Low Oxygen blocks expansion
- Survival Game protection

### With Seasonal Transitions

- Low Oxygen can force Winter season
- High Oxygen enables all season transitions
- Oxygen affects season strategy

---

## Strategic Notes

### Optimal Use

- Maintain Oxygen >3 months (major bet threshold)
- Use active Engines to offset decay
- Balance Oxygen with other resources
- Don't hoard excessively (reduces Meaning)

### Pitfalls

- Letting Oxygen decay to zero
- Relying only on manual savings
- Ignoring Engines (decay will drain Oxygen)
- Hoarding excessively (Meaning penalty)

### Tradeoffs

- Saving increases Oxygen but reduces Meaning (if excessive)
- Building Engines requires Energy but maintains Oxygen
- High Oxygen enables risk but requires maintenance
- Balance between safety and growth

---

## Oxygen Thresholds

### Critical (<0.5 months)

- Triggers Financial Stress failure state
- Cannot make major bets
- Stress events occur
- Meaning decays

### Low (0.5-1 months)

- Stress warnings
- Limited risk-taking
- Focus on survival

### Stable (1-3 months)

- Standard operation
- Some risk capacity
- Balanced play

### High (3+ months)

- Major bets enabled
- High risk tolerance
- Strategic flexibility

### Very High (6+ months)

- Maximum safety
- Enables all actions
- Long-term security

---

## Design Intent

Oxygen creates survival security.

It decays if not maintained.

Engines are the primary maintenance method.

Low Oxygen creates real consequences.

High Oxygen enables strategic play.

Balance with Meaning is required.
