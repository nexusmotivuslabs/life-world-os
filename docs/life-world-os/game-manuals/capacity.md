# CAPACITY

Life World OS Game Manual

## Overview

Capacity is the stat that governs the Energy Game. It represents health, energy, nervous system resilience, and the ability to sustain effort over time. Low Capacity creates severe penalties.

---

## What Capacity Can Do

### Higher Energy Regeneration

- Capacity modifies usable Energy cap
- High Capacity (80+) provides bonus Energy (110 vs 100 base)
- Low Capacity (<30) caps Energy at 70

### Better XP Efficiency

- High Capacity increases XP gain by 10% (at 80+)
- Low Capacity reduces XP efficiency to 70%
- Capacity directly affects all XP calculations

### Resilience to Pressure

- High Capacity protects against Burnout
- Reduces failure state penalties
- Enables sustained effort

---

## What Capacity Cannot Do

### Be Instantly Restored

- Capacity recovers slowly over time
- Requires rest actions (not work)
- Cannot be bought with Gold

### Replace Rest

- Rest is required to maintain Capacity
- Work actions consume Capacity over time
- Overwork reduces Capacity permanently until rest

### Bypass Burnout

- Even high Capacity can trigger Burnout if neglected
- Sustained low Capacity eventually triggers failure state
- Capacity must be actively maintained

## Attributes

### Sources

1. **Exercise Actions**
   - Direct Capacity improvement
   - +250 capacity XP per action
   - Requires Energy investment (25 energy)

2. **Rest and Recovery**
   - Winter season allows Capacity recovery
   - Rest actions restore Capacity
   - Sleep and downtime (implicit)

3. **Nutrition and Health**
   - Water resource affects Capacity maintenance
   - Health actions support Capacity
   - Stress management (Armor resource)

4. **Stress Management**
   - Low stress maintains Capacity
   - High stress reduces Capacity
   - Armor resource protects Capacity

### Methods to Gain

- Exercise actions (primary method)
- Rest periods (Winter season)
- Health-maintaining actions
- Stress reduction

### Methods to Lose

- Overwork (excessive Work actions)
- Neglect (no exercise for 7+ days triggers decay)
- Burnout (failure state)
- High stress (low Armor, high pressure)

### Decay

- Capacity decays by -2 points per week if neglected
- Neglect = no capacity-improving actions for 7 days
- Decay stops at Capacity 20 (floor)

## Rule Interactions

### With Energy Resource

- Capacity directly modifies usable Energy cap
- Low Capacity = less daily Energy
- High Capacity = bonus daily Energy
- This is the primary lever of Capacity

### With XP System

- Capacity modifies XP gain efficiency
- Low Capacity = 70% XP efficiency
- High Capacity = 110% XP efficiency
- All actions affected

### With Burnout Failure State

- Low Capacity (<30) for 14 days triggers Burnout
- Burnout severely restricts Energy (cap at 50)
- Recovery requires Capacity >50 for 7 days
- Capacity is the primary defense against Burnout

### With Over-Optimization Penalties

- Excessive Work actions reduce Capacity (-3 points weekly)
- This prevents Power Game over-optimization
- Balance required between Work and Capacity maintenance

---

## Strategic Notes

### Optimal Use

- Maintain Capacity above 60 for full Energy access
- Exercise regularly (prevents decay)
- Balance Work with rest
- Monitor Capacity weekly to prevent decay

### Pitfalls

- Ignoring Capacity for Power Game gains
- Assuming Capacity will maintain itself
- Overwork without rest
- Neglecting exercise (decay trigger)

### Tradeoffs

- Work actions generate Gold but risk Capacity
- Exercise consumes Energy but improves Capacity
- Rest reduces immediate progress but enables long-term Capacity
- Balance required across all actions

## Capacity Modifier Table

| Capacity Range | Usable Energy Cap | XP Efficiency | Recovery Rate |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 0-29          | 70                | 70%           | 50%           |
| 30-59         | 85                | 85%           | 75%           |
| 60-79         | 100               | 100%          | 100%          |
| 80-100        | 110               | 110%          | 125%          |

## Design Intent

Capacity is the foundation of all other games.

Low Capacity cripples everything.

High Capacity enables everything.

The system punishes Capacity neglect severely.

Capacity cannot be bypassed or ignored.
