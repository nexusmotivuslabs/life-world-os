# ENGINES

Life World OS Game Manual

## Overview

Engines are the value creation mechanisms that generate income, Gold, and Oxygen. They represent sustainable income sources: Career, Business, Investment, and Learning. The Engines stat governs their effectiveness.

---

## What Engines Can Do

### Generate Gold/Oxygen

- Active Engines produce monthly income
- Converts effort into resources
- Creates sustainable wealth generation

### Create Optionality

- Multiple Engines increase Optionality stat
- Diversification reduces risk
- More Engines = more options

### Build Wealth

- Engines compound over time
- Long-term income generation
- Creates financial independence

---

## What Engines Cannot Do

### Replace Capacity

- Engines require Capacity to operate
- Low Capacity reduces Engine effectiveness
- Cannot bypass Energy Game constraints

### Provide Instant Results

- Engines take time to build
- Investment Engine requires initial capital
- Business Engine requires development
- Patience required

### Guarantee Success

- Engines have fragility scores
- Market changes affect performance
- Engines can fail or reduce output
- Risk exists

## Attributes

### Sources

1. **Career Engine**
   - Salary income
   - Stable but limited
   - Fragility: Low (employment risk)

2. **Business Engine**
   - Entrepreneurship, side projects
   - High potential, high risk
   - Fragility: High (market risk)

3. **Investment Engine**
   - Passive income, assets
   - Requires initial capital
   - Fragility: Medium (market risk)

4. **Learning Engine**
   - Skills → income conversion
   - Long-term investment
   - Fragility: Low (skill doesn't disappear)

### Methods to Gain

- Create new Engines (investment of Gold/Energy)
- Improve existing Engines (increase output)
- Diversify (multiple Engine types)
- Increase Engines stat (improves all Engines)

### Methods to Lose

- Neglect (Engines require maintenance)
- Fragility events (market changes, job loss)
- Poor decisions (bad investments)
- Over-leverage (too much risk)

### Engines Stat

- Governs income generation effectiveness
- High Engines stat increases all Engine outputs
- Low Engines stat reduces income
- Affected by XP gains and actions

---

## Rule Interactions

### With Gold Resource

- Engines generate Gold directly
- More active Engines = more Gold
- Engines stat multiplies Gold generation

### With Oxygen Resource

- Engines generate Oxygen (months of expenses)
- Stable Engines = stable Oxygen
- Engine failures reduce Oxygen

### With Optionality Stat

- Multiple Engines increase Optionality
- Diversification creates options
- Single Engine reduces Optionality (risk)

### With Failure States

- Engine failures can trigger Financial Stress
- Multiple Engines protect against single failure
- Low Engines stat restricts available actions

---

## Strategic Notes

### Optimal Use

- Diversify across Engine types
- Maintain multiple Engines (reduces risk)
- Invest in Engines stat (multiplier effect)
- Balance active vs passive Engines

### Pitfalls

- Relying on single Engine (fragility risk)
- Neglecting Engine maintenance
- Over-investing in high-risk Engines
- Ignoring fragility scores

### Tradeoffs

- Building Engines requires Energy/Gold
- Active Engines require ongoing effort
- Investment Engine requires initial capital
- Balance between building and maintaining
