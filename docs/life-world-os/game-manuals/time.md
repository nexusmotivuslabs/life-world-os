# TIME

Life World OS Game Manual

## Overview

Time is the active force that creates pressure, applies decay, and enables long-term investments to mature. Time cannot be reversed, paused, or ignored. It is the mechanism that makes decisions meaningful through consequences.

---

## What Time Can Do

### Long-Term Investment Maturation

- Investments compound across seasons
- Long-term actions mature over time
- Patience creates value

### Decay Creates Urgency

- Resources decay over time
- Stats degrade if neglected
- Inaction has consequences
- Time pressure forces engagement

---

## What Time Cannot Do

### Be Reversed

- Time moves forward only
- Decisions are permanent
- Cannot undo past actions
- History is immutable

### Be Paused

- Time ticks continue
- Decay applies even when offline
- Cannot stop the clock
- System continues

### Be Ignored

- Time affects everything
- Decay applies automatically
- Neglect compounds over time
- Consequences accumulate

## Attributes

### Sources

1. **Daily Ticks**
   - Runs once per calendar day
   - Applies daily decay
   - Resets Energy
   - Advances day counter

2. **Weekly Ticks**
   - Runs every 7 daily ticks
   - Evaluates imbalance
   - Applies over-optimization penalties
   - Weekly decay checks

3. **Seasonal Checkpoints**
   - Runs at season end
   - Evaluates milestones
   - Season transition logic
   - Long-term evaluation

### Methods to Gain

- Time cannot be gained
- Time only moves forward
- Cannot create more time

### Methods to Lose

- Time always moves forward
- Cannot stop time
- Cannot reverse time
- Time is consumed by all actions

### Time Pressure

- Daily decay creates urgency
- Weekly penalties force balance
- Seasonal checkpoints create milestones
- Long-term consequences accumulate

---

## Rule Interactions

### With Decay

- Time triggers all decay
- Daily decay applies on daily tick
- Weekly decay applies on weekly tick
- Time is decay mechanism

### With Investment Maturation

- Investments compound over time
- Long-term actions require seasons
- Patience creates value
- Time enables compounding

### With Failure Accumulation

- Failure states accumulate over time
- Neglect compounds penalties
- Recovery requires time
- Time creates failure pressure

### With Energy

- Energy resets at daily tick
- Time governs Energy regeneration
- Daily allocation from time
- Time creates Energy scarcity

---

## Strategic Notes

### Optimal Use

- Plan for long-term investments
- Maintain stats to prevent decay
- Use time pressure strategically
- Balance immediate vs long-term

### Pitfalls

- Ignoring decay (compounds over time)
- Only short-term thinking
- Not using time for compounding
- Fighting against time pressure

### Tradeoffs

- Immediate actions vs long-term investments
- Time pressure vs careful planning
- Decay prevention vs growth
- Balance required across time horizons

---

## Time Mechanics

### Daily Tick

**What happens:**
- Energy resets (modified by Capacity)
- Daily decay applies (Oxygen: -0.1 months if no Engines)
- Day counter advances
- Stat decay checks (if neglected)

**Frequency:** Once per calendar day per player

**Offline behavior:** Missed ticks replay deterministically

### Weekly Tick

**What happens:**
- Over-optimization evaluation
- Weekly decay checks (Capacity, Meaning, Optionality if neglected)
- Imbalance penalties
- Action distribution analysis

**Frequency:** Every 7 daily ticks

**Offline behavior:** Calculates and applies all missed weekly ticks

### Seasonal Checkpoint

**What happens:**
- Milestone evaluation
- Season outcome assessment
- Long-term investment maturation
- Season transition validation

**Frequency:** At season end

**Offline behavior:** Evaluates when season ends

---

## Time and Decay

### Daily Decay

- Oxygen: -0.1 months per day (if no Engines)
- Applies automatically
- Cannot be stopped
- Only offset by Engines

### Weekly Decay (if neglected)

- Capacity: -2 points (if no capacity-improving actions)
- Meaning: -1 point (if value drift)
- Optionality: -2 points (if stagnation)

### Decay Prevention

- Active maintenance prevents decay
- Engines offset Oxygen decay
- Regular actions prevent stat decay
- Time cannot be stopped, only managed

---

## Long-Term Investments

### Compounding Over Time

- Investments generate returns across seasons
- Patience creates value
- Time enables compounding
- Long-term thinking required

### Investment Maturation

- Some actions mature over seasons
- Long-term strategies require time
- Quick wins vs long-term value
- Time creates strategic depth

---

## Design Intent

Time creates pressure.

Decay applies automatically.

Inaction has consequences.

Time enables long-term value.

Time cannot be bypassed or ignored.

Time makes decisions meaningful.

Time is the foundation of consequences.
