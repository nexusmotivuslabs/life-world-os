- Reduces friction in aligned actions

### Burnout Resistance

- High Meaning protects against Burnout failure state
- Reduces Capacity drain from overwork
- Provides psychological resilience

### Decay Protection

- High Meaning reduces decay rates
- Protects other stats from degradation
- Creates stability through alignment

---

## What Meaning Cannot Do

### Be Faked

- Meaning requires genuine values alignment
- Actions must match stated values
- Cannot be bought with Gold
- Inauthentic actions reduce Meaning

### Replace Resources

- Meaning doesn't generate Gold or Oxygen
- Still need Engines for income
- Resources are separate from purpose

### Be Static

- Meaning requires maintenance
- Values drift creates decay
- Must be actively aligned
- Changes over time

### Decay

- **Weekly decay:** -1 point per week if value drift
- **Value drift definition:** Actions consistently misaligned with stated values

## Rule Interactions

### With Decay Rates

- High Meaning reduces overall decay rates
- Low Meaning accelerates decay
- Meaning is decay protection stat

### With Burnout

- High Meaning protects against Burnout
- Reduces Capacity drain from overwork
- Provides psychological resilience
- Low Meaning increases Burnout risk

### With Over-Optimization Penalties

- Balance required between resources and Meaning

### With Failure States

- Low Meaning increases failure state risk
- High Meaning provides resilience
- Meaning affects recovery rates

---

## Strategic Notes

### Optimal Use

- Align actions with values
- Regular value-aligned actions prevent decay
- Balance resource accumulation with Meaning
- Monitor for value drift

### Pitfalls

- Hoarding excessively (Meaning penalty)
- Inauthentic actions (reduces Meaning)
- Assuming Meaning maintains itself

### Tradeoffs

- Some high-reward actions may misalign with values
- Hoarding increases Oxygen but reduces Meaning
- Power Game optimization can conflict with Meaning
- Balance required across all games

---

## Meaning Thresholds

### Critical (<20)

- Maximum decay rate
- High failure state risk
- No burnout protection
- Floor value (cannot go lower)

### Low (20-30)

- Accelerated decay
- Reduced resilience
- High burnout risk
- Focus on recovery

### Medium (31-60)

- Standard operation
- Normal decay rates
- Basic resilience
- Balanced play

### High (61-80)

- Decay protection
- Burnout resistance
- Increased resilience
- Optimal range

### Very High (81-100)

- Maximum decay protection
- Strong burnout resistance
- High resilience
- Purpose-driven play

---

## Value Alignment

### Identifying Value Drift

- Actions don't match stated values
- Feeling inauthentic
- No purpose in activities
- Doing things "because I should"

### Correcting Value Drift

- Pause and reflect on values
- Align actions with values

It cannot be faked or bought.

Value drift creates decay.

High Meaning protects everything else.
