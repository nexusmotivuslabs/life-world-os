# OPTIONALITY

Life World OS Game Manual

## Overview

Optionality is the stat that represents freedom of choice, risk tolerance, and strategic flexibility. It governs available actions, unlocks higher-risk options, and reduces failure penalties. High Optionality means more choices and better outcomes from those choices.

---

## What Optionality Can Do

### Freedom of Choice

- High Optionality unlocks more actions
- Provides strategic flexibility
- Enables adaptive play

### Risk Tolerance

- High Optionality enables higher-risk actions
- Better outcomes from risky choices
- Reduced failure penalties

### Strategic Flexibility

- More options in any situation
- Ability to pivot quickly
- Reduces dependency on single path

---

## What Optionality Cannot Do

### Be Hoarded Indefinitely

- Optionality decays if resources stagnate
- Requires active use to maintain
- Idle resources reduce Optionality

### Replace Action

- Optionality enables actions but doesn't execute them
- Still requires Energy to act
- Options without action are meaningless

### Be Free

- Optionality requires investment
- Building options costs Energy/Gold
- Maintaining Optionality requires diversity

## Attributes

### Sources

1. **Assets**
   - Savings (Gold/Oxygen)
   - Investments
   - Property/valuables

2. **Skills**
   - Learning actions build skills
   - Mastery creates options
   - Multiple skills = more options

3. **Savings**
   - High Oxygen increases Optionality
   - Financial buffer creates freedom
   - Resources enable choices

4. **Relationships**
   - Network provides options
   - Connections create opportunities
   - Community support

5. **Engines**
   - Multiple Engines increase Optionality
   - Diversification creates options
   - Less dependency on single source

### Methods to Gain

- Learning actions (build skills)
- Save Expenses (build resources)
- Create multiple Engines (diversification)
- Build assets (investments)
- Relationship-building

### Methods to Lose

- Stagnation (resources idle, no action diversity)
- Resource misuse (poor decisions)
- Decay (if not actively maintained)
- Over-reliance on single path

### Decay

- **Weekly decay:** -2 points per week if stagnation
- **Stagnation definition:** Resources idle and no action diversity for 7 days
- **Decay stops:** When Optionality hits 20 (floor)
- **Accelerated decay:** Low Optionality (<25) increases decay risk

## Rule Interactions

### With Available Actions

- High Optionality unlocks higher-risk actions
- Low Optionality restricts available choices
- Optionality gates action availability

### With Failure Penalties

- High Optionality reduces failure state penalties
- Low Optionality increases failure severity
- Optionality provides resilience

### With Over-Optimization Penalties

- Excessive Learning without Execution reduces Optionality (-3 points weekly)
- Learning must be applied to maintain Optionality
- Balance required between learning and action

### With Risk/Reward

- High Optionality enables higher-risk, higher-reward actions
- Low Optionality restricts to safe actions only
- Optionality multiplies reward potential

---

## Strategic Notes

### Optimal Use

- Maintain action diversity (prevents stagnation)
- Balance learning with execution
- Build multiple Engines (diversification)
- Use resources actively (prevents decay)

### Pitfalls

- Learning without application (Optionality decay)
- Hoarding resources without using them
- Over-reliance on single Engine
- Stagnation from lack of action diversity

### Tradeoffs

- Learning builds Optionality but requires Energy
- Saving increases Optionality but requires Meaning balance
- Multiple Engines create Optionality but require maintenance
- Balance required across all actions

---

## Optionality Thresholds

### Critical (<20)

- Severely restricted actions
- High failure penalties
- No risk tolerance
- Floor value (cannot go lower)

### Low (20-40)

- Limited action choices
- High failure penalties
- Low risk tolerance
- Focus on building

### Medium (41-60)

- Standard action availability
- Normal failure penalties
- Moderate risk tolerance
- Balanced play

### High (61-80)

- Many action choices
- Reduced failure penalties
- High risk tolerance
- Strategic flexibility

### Very High (81-100)

- Maximum action choices
- Minimal failure penalties
- Maximum risk tolerance
- Full strategic freedom

---

## Action Diversity

### Preventing Stagnation

- Mix action types (Work, Exercise, Learning, Save)
- Avoid single-action focus
- Regular action variety
- Use different action categories

### Building Optionality

- Learn new skills (Learning actions)
- Build assets (Investments)
- Create Engines (diversification)
- Save resources (buffer)

### Maintaining Optionality

- Use resources actively
- Maintain action diversity
- Apply learning to execution
- Avoid stagnation patterns

---

## Design Intent

Optionality creates freedom.

It requires active maintenance.

Stagnation reduces Optionality.

High Optionality enables better play.

Low Optionality restricts choices.

Balance between building and using is required.

Optionality is the bridge between resources and freedom.
