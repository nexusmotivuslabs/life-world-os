## Game Element Mappings

### Power Game

**Life World OS Implementation:**

- **Engines Stat** (0-100)
  - Governs income generation capability
  - High Engines unlocks higher-value actions
  - Reflects multiple income sources

- **Gold Resource**
  - Primary currency of influence
  - Generated by active Engines
  - Used for investments, purchases

- **Engines System**
  - Career Engine (salary)
  - Business Engine (entrepreneurship)
  - Investment Engine (passive income)
  - Learning Engine (skills → income)

- **Investment System**
  - Assets generate returns
  - Compounds over time
  - Increases Gold/Oxygen

**Mechanics:**
- Engines generate Gold/Oxygen through active Engines
- High Engines stat increases income multipliers
- Investments compound across seasons
- Low Engines restricts available actions

---

### Survival Game

**Life World OS Implementation:**

- **Oxygen Resource** (months of expenses)
  - Primary survival buffer
  - Decays daily if not maintained
  - Enables risk-taking when high

- **Capacity Stat** (0-100)
  - Health, energy, resilience
  - Governs energy regeneration
  - Low Capacity = survival risk

- **Water Resource** (0-100)
  - Health and vitality score
  - Low Water triggers Winter season
  - Blocks progression when too low

- **Armor Resource** (0-100)
  - Systems, buffers, boundaries
  - Protects against stress events
  - Reduces failure state penalties

**Mechanics:**
- Oxygen decays daily (survival requires maintenance)
- Low Water forces rest (Winter season)
- Capacity governs survival capability (energy, health)
- Armor mitigates failure state effects

---

### Energy Game

**Life World OS Implementation:**

- **Energy Resource** (daily budget, 0-110)
  - Daily allocation of vitality
  - All actions consume Energy
  - Resets at daily tick

- **Capacity Stat** (0-100)
  - Governs usable Energy cap
  - Low Capacity = less daily Energy
  - High Capacity = bonus Energy

- **Exercise Actions**
  - Directly improve Capacity
  - Consume Energy to gain Capacity
  - Essential for Energy Game health

- **Burnout Failure State**
  - Triggered by low Capacity + overwork
  - Restricts Energy severely
  - Requires recovery period

**Mechanics:**
- Daily Energy budget forces prioritization
- Capacity modifies usable Energy (leverages Energy Game)
- Burnout punishes Energy Game neglect
- Exercise/rest restore Capacity (Energy Game currency)

---

### Meaning Game

**Life World OS Implementation:**

- **Meaning Stat** (0-100)
  - Purpose, values alignment
  - Decay protection when high
  - Burnout resistance

- **Value-Aligned Actions**
  - Actions that match user's stated values
  - Higher Meaning XP when aligned
  - Meaning decay when misaligned

- **Decay Mechanics**
  - Meaning decays when actions drift from values
  - Requires conscious alignment
  - Cannot be faked

**Mechanics:**
- Meaning stat reduces decay rates (resilience)
- Value drift triggers Meaning decay
- High Meaning protects against burnout
- Meaning cannot be bought with Gold

---

### Mastery Game

**Life World OS Implementation:**

- **Learning Engine**
  - Skills development
  - Knowledge accumulation
  - Network building

- **Learning Actions**
  - Direct skill building
  - XP gains in multiple categories
  - Increases Optionality

- **XP System**
  - Overall progression
  - Category-specific progression
  - Ranks and levels

- **Optionality Stat** (0-100)
  - Skills create options
  - High Optionality unlocks actions
  - Mastery increases Optionality

**Mechanics:**
- Learning actions build skills (Mastery Game currency)
- XP tracks progression (Mastery Game metric)
- Optionality unlocks higher-level actions
- Learning without execution reduces Optionality (penalty)

---

### Time Game

**Life World OS Implementation:**

- **Time Ticks**
  - Daily Tick (decay, regeneration)
  - Weekly Tick (imbalance, penalties)
  - Seasonal Checkpoint (evaluation)

- **Energy Budget**
  - Forces attention to what matters
  - Limited daily allocation
  - Cannot do everything

- **Seasonal Cycles**
  - Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter
  - Enforce rest periods
  - Create time pressure

- **Optionality Stat** (0-100)
  - Freedom of schedule
  - High Optionality = more time freedom
  - Low Optionality = constrained

**Mechanics:**
- Daily Energy budget forces time management
- Seasonal cycles create time pressure
- Time ticks apply decay (inaction has cost)
- Optionality represents time freedom

---

### Relationship Game

**Life World OS Implementation:**

*Not yet explicitly modeled*

**Current Implicit Integration:**

- Meaning stat (values alignment implies relationship health)
- Optionality stat (relationships create options)
- Meaning decay when actions are transactional

**Future Expansion:**

- Relationship resource/stat
- Relationship-building actions
- Relationship decay mechanics
- Relationship Game explicit tracking

---

## Consciousness and Choice Mechanics

### Current Implementation

**Awareness Elements:**

- Balance indicators (show which stats are low)
- Season system (forces intentional mode-switching)
- Over-optimization penalties (reveal single-game focus)
- Failure states (reveal neglected games)

**Choice Elements:**

- Seasonal transitions (require conscious choice)
- Action selection (Energy budget forces choice)
- Tradeoff visibility (actions show costs/benefits)

### Missing Explicitly

- Consciousness tracking stat
- Awareness sidequests
- Choice history/logging
- Meta-game progression

### Future Expansion

**Consciousness Stat:**
- Tracks awareness level (0-100)
- Increases through reflection/awareness actions
- Unlocks meta-game features

**Choice Mechanics:**
- Log game-switching decisions
- Track tradeoff acceptance
- Reward conscious choices

**Sidequest System:**
- "Which game am I playing?" quests
- "Switch games intentionally" challenges
- "Accept tradeoff consciously" exercises

## Cross-Game Interactions

### Synergies

1. **High Energy → Better Power Game**
   - More Energy = more Work actions
   - High Capacity = higher income potential

2. **High Meaning → Energy Game Protection**
   - Meaning reduces burnout risk
   - Purpose protects against depletion

3. **High Mastery → Increased Optionality**
   - Skills create more options
   - Learning unlocks new actions

4. **High Optionality → Survival Game Stability**
   - More options = less stress
   - Flexibility = better survival

### Tensions

1. **Power Game vs Energy Game**
   - Too much Work → Capacity reduction
   - Over-optimization penalty

2. **Survival Game vs Optionality**
   - Hoarding (high Oxygen) → Meaning decay
   - Over-optimization penalty

3. **Mastery Game vs Optionality**
   - Learning without execution → Optionality decay
   - Over-optimization penalty

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1 (Current)

Focus on making existing game mechanics real:
- Energy constraints
- Decay mechanics
- Failure states
- Over-optimization penalties

### Phase 2 (Future)

Explicit Consciousness/Choice mechanics:
- Consciousness stat
- Awareness sidequests
- Choice tracking
- Meta-game progression

### Phase 3 (Future)

Relationship Game integration:
- Relationship resource
- Relationship actions
- Relationship decay
- Relationship Game balance

## Design Intent

Life World OS makes the 7 Games explicit.

It shows players they are playing multiple games.

It punishes single-game optimization.

It rewards conscious game-switching.

The meta-game (Consciousness and Choice) is the ultimate goal.
