# Phase 1 Completion — Life World OS

Status: COMPLETE AND SEALED

Phase Name:
Make the World Real

Objective:
Turn a dashboard into a mechanically honest system.

Completed Steps:
1. Energy as first-class resource
2. Universal action cost enforcement
3. Deterministic daily tick
4. Decay mechanics active
5. Capacity affects outcomes
6. Burnout failure state
7. Over-optimisation penalties
8. UI locked to engine truth

Phase 1 Invariants:
- Scarcity exists
- Time progresses independently
- Inaction has cost
- Effort degrades under strain
- Failure states are real
- Imbalanced success is punished
- UI is a pure projection

Phase 1 is sealed.
All future phases must build on these rules.
