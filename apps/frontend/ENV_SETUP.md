# Environment Setup

## Frontend .env File

Create `apps/frontend/.env` with the following:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Notes

- This file is required for the frontend to connect to the backend API
- Change the URL if your backend runs on a different port
- For production, use your production API URL
