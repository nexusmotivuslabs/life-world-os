  PHYSICAL_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'The biological fuel supply: sleep, exercise, and nutrition. The raw energy your body produces and the capacity to sustain effort.',
    keyInsight: 'Physical energy is the foundation of all other energy types. Mental and emotional energy collapse without it. Fix physical energy first.',

    keyRisks: 'Sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyle, poor nutrition, stimulant dependency masking fatigue.',
    practicalApplication: 'Sleep 7-9 hours consistently. Move daily. Eat whole foods. Track energy levels to identify patterns.',
  },
  SLEEP_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'Sleep as the primary mechanism for energy restoration. The non-negotiable foundation of daily energy capacity.',
    keyInsight: 'One night of poor sleep reduces cognitive performance by 20-30%. Sleep debt compounds. You cannot make up for chronic sleep loss.',
    howItWorks: 'NREM sleep restores physical energy. REM sleep restores mental energy. Consistency of timing matters more than total hours.',
    keyRisks: 'Irregular schedule, blue light before bed, caffeine after noon, alcohol, believing you can function on less.',
    practicalApplication: 'Same bedtime daily. Dark, cool room. No screens 1hr before bed. Track sleep quality, not just duration.',
  },
  EXERCISE_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'Physical activity as a long-term energy capacity builder. Counterintuitively, spending energy on exercise creates more energy.',
    keyInsight: 'Exercise does not drain energy — it builds energy capacity. Regular exercise increases mitochondrial density, improving baseline energy production.',
    howItWorks: 'Cardiovascular exercise creates new mitochondria. Strength training improves metabolic efficiency. Both improve sleep quality. The compound effect is massive.',
    keyRisks: 'Overtraining without recovery, all-or-nothing mindset, skipping exercise when energy is low (when it helps most).',
    practicalApplication: 'Move for at least 30 minutes daily. Mix cardio and strength. Exercise even when tired — start with 10 minutes and reassess.',
  },
  NUTRITION_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'Food quality and timing as determinants of sustained energy levels throughout the day.',
    keyInsight: 'Energy crashes are almost always nutrition-driven. Stable blood sugar = stable energy. The quality of fuel determines the quality of output.',
    howItWorks: 'Whole foods provide sustained energy. Protein stabilises blood sugar. Fibre slows glucose absorption. Processed carbs cause spikes and crashes.',
    keyRisks: 'Sugar-driven energy spikes, skipping meals, caffeine replacing nutrition, emotional eating.',
    practicalApplication: 'Protein at every meal. Minimise refined sugar. Eat before you are starving. Hydrate consistently throughout the day.',
  },
  CIRCADIAN_RHYTHM: {
    definition: 'The internal 24-hour biological clock that regulates energy, alertness, hormones, and sleep-wake cycles.',
    keyInsight: 'Fighting your circadian rhythm is fighting biology. Aligning work with your natural energy peaks can double productivity without extra effort.',
    howItWorks: 'Light exposure sets the clock. Cortisol peaks in morning (alertness). Melatonin rises at night (sleepiness). Consistent timing strengthens the cycle.',
    keyRisks: 'Irregular light exposure, shift work, late-night screens, jet lag, ignoring personal chronotype.',
    practicalApplication: 'Get bright light within 30 minutes of waking. Schedule deep work during peak alertness. Dim lights 2 hours before bed.',
  },
  MENTAL_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'Cognitive fuel for focus, decision-making, and creative thinking. A finite daily resource that depletes with use.',
    keyInsight: 'Mental energy is your scarcest resource. You have 4-6 hours of peak cognitive capacity per day. How you allocate those hours determines your output.',
    howItWorks: 'Prefrontal cortex consumes glucose for executive function. Each decision depletes the supply. Recovery requires rest, not stimulants.',
    keyRisks: 'Context switching, decision overload, multitasking, notifications, spending peak hours on low-value tasks.',
    practicalApplication: 'Protect your first 4 hours for the most important work. Batch low-energy tasks. Eliminate unnecessary decisions.',
  },
  FOCUS_CAPACITY: {
    definition: 'The ability to sustain directed attention on a single task. The engine of deep work and meaningful output.',
    keyInsight: 'Focus is not about willpower — it is about environment. Removing distractions is 10x more effective than resisting them.',
    howItWorks: 'Attention is managed by the prefrontal cortex. Context switching costs 15-25 minutes of recovery. Deep focus requires elimination of competing stimuli.',
    keyRisks: 'Open office distractions, phone notifications, email checking, unclear priorities, attempting too many projects.',
    practicalApplication: 'Time-block focus sessions. Turn off all notifications. Single-task. Work in 60-90 minute blocks with breaks.',
  },
  COGNITIVE_LOAD: {
    definition: 'The total demand on mental processing at any given time. When load exceeds capacity, performance degrades sharply.',
    keyInsight: 'Cognitive overload does not cause gradual decline — it causes sudden collapse. Operating at 90% load means one more input causes a crash.',
    howItWorks: 'Working memory holds 4±1 items. Each open loop, unfinished task, and pending decision occupies a slot. Externalisation frees capacity.',
    keyRisks: 'Too many open projects, unwritten commitments, cluttered workspace, information overload.',
    practicalApplication: 'Write everything down. Close open loops daily. Limit work-in-progress to 3 items. Use checklists for routine tasks.',
  },
  DECISION_FATIGUE: {
    definition: 'The progressive deterioration of decision quality after making many decisions. The silent energy drain.',
    keyInsight: 'Every decision — even trivial ones — depletes the same energy pool. Reducing daily decisions by 50% can double the quality of important ones.',
    howItWorks: 'Willpower and decision-making share a common resource. As decisions accumulate, the brain defaults to the easiest option or avoids deciding entirely.',
    keyRisks: 'Too many daily choices, no decision frameworks, perfectionism on trivial decisions, not automating routine choices.',
    practicalApplication: 'Automate routine decisions (meals, clothes, schedule). Make important decisions in the morning. Use decision frameworks for recurring choices.',
  },
  CREATIVE_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'The capacity for novel thinking, idea generation, and creative problem-solving. Operates on different cycles than analytical energy.',
    keyInsight: 'Creativity peaks during low arousal states — when you are slightly tired, walking, or in the shower. High-focus and high-creativity rarely coexist.',
    howItWorks: 'Default mode network activates during rest, connecting disparate ideas. Constraints stimulate creativity. Incubation (stepping away) often solves stuck problems.',
    keyRisks: 'Over-scheduling with no slack time, expecting creativity on demand, skipping incubation, judging ideas too early.',
    practicalApplication: 'Schedule unstructured time. Walk without headphones. Capture ideas immediately. Separate idea generation from idea evaluation.',
  },
  EMOTIONAL_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'The fuel for motivation, resilience, and interpersonal engagement. Determines how you show up, not just what you do.',
    keyInsight: 'Emotional energy is contagious and self-reinforcing. Positive emotional states create energy; negative states consume it. Managing emotional energy is managing your trajectory.',
    howItWorks: 'Positive emotions broaden attention and build resources. Negative emotions narrow focus and deplete reserves. Social interactions can charge or drain.',
    keyRisks: 'Toxic relationships, rumination, suppressing emotions, emotional labour without recovery, social media comparison.',
    practicalApplication: 'Audit relationships for energy impact. Process negative emotions rather than suppressing. Schedule social recharging.',
  },
  MOTIVATION: {
    definition: 'The drive to initiate and sustain action. Not a feeling to wait for, but a system to design.',
    keyInsight: 'Motivation follows action, not the other way around. Start small and momentum builds. Waiting to feel motivated is the most common procrastination trap.',
    howItWorks: 'Dopamine drives anticipation of reward. Intrinsic motivation (autonomy, mastery, purpose) is more sustainable than extrinsic. Environment design beats willpower.',
    keyRisks: 'Relying on motivation instead of systems, dopamine burnout from instant gratification, unclear purpose.',
    practicalApplication: 'Start with 2-minute version of any task. Design environment for action. Connect daily tasks to larger purpose. Protect dopamine sensitivity.',
  },
  RESILIENCE: {
    definition: 'The capacity to recover from setbacks, stress, and adversity. Not the absence of difficulty, but the speed of recovery.',
    keyInsight: 'Resilience is built through exposure and recovery, like muscle. Avoiding all stress creates fragility. Controlled exposure with adequate recovery builds antifragility.',
    howItWorks: 'Stress triggers adaptation response. Recovery allows adaptation to complete. Repeated cycles increase capacity. Social support accelerates recovery.',
    keyRisks: 'Chronic stress without recovery, avoidance of all challenges, isolation during difficulty, ignoring warning signs.',
    practicalApplication: 'Seek challenges slightly beyond current ability. Build recovery rituals. Maintain social connections. Reframe setbacks as data.',
  },
  EMOTIONAL_REGULATION: {
    definition: 'The ability to manage emotional states consciously rather than reactively. The skill that prevents emotional energy leaks.',
    keyInsight: 'You cannot control what you feel, but you can control how long you feel it. The gap between stimulus and response is where emotional regulation lives.',
    howItWorks: 'Awareness of emotional state → labelling the emotion → choosing response. Naming emotions reduces amygdala activation by up to 50%.',
    keyRisks: 'Emotional suppression (not the same as regulation), reactive decision-making, emotional contagion from others.',
    practicalApplication: 'Name the emotion when you feel it. Pause before reacting. Use breathing to activate parasympathetic response. Journal to process.',
  },
  ENERGY_MANAGEMENT: {
    definition: 'The practice of consciously allocating, conserving, and renewing energy across all dimensions — physical, mental, and emotional.',
    keyInsight: 'Energy management is more important than time management. You can have all the time in the world but accomplish nothing without energy to use it.',
    howItWorks: 'Audit energy inputs and drains. Allocate peak energy to highest-value work. Build renewal rituals into the day. Track patterns to optimise.',
    keyRisks: 'Treating all hours as equal, ignoring energy cycles, optimising time without optimising energy, burnout.',
    practicalApplication: 'Map your energy peaks and valleys for one week. Schedule your most important work during peaks. Build micro-recovery into transitions.',
  },
  ENERGY_ALLOCATION: {
    definition: 'Directing finite energy to the activities that produce the most value. The Pareto principle applied to personal energy.',
    keyInsight: '20% of your activities produce 80% of your results but may not be where you spend 80% of your energy. Realigning energy to value is the highest-leverage change.',
    howItWorks: 'Identify highest-value activities. Schedule them during peak energy windows. Delegate, automate, or eliminate low-value energy drains.',
    keyRisks: 'Spending peak energy on email and meetings, saying yes to everything, not knowing which activities create most value.',
    practicalApplication: 'List your top 3 value-creating activities. Protect time and energy for them daily. Say no to everything that competes.',
  },
  ENERGY_CONSERVATION: {
    definition: 'Systematically eliminating unnecessary energy drains. Plugging the leaks before trying to increase capacity.',
    keyInsight: 'Most people try to add energy (supplements, caffeine) instead of removing drains. Eliminating one major energy drain often matters more than adding three energy sources.',
    howItWorks: 'Identify recurring energy drains: bad sleep, toxic relationships, cluttered environment, unnecessary decisions, multitasking. Remove or minimise each.',
    keyRisks: 'Not recognising drains because they are habitual, tolerating "small" drains that compound, using stimulants to mask the problem.',
    practicalApplication: 'Track energy levels hourly for 3 days. Identify the top 3 drains. Eliminate or reduce one per week. Protect the gains.',
  },
  ENERGY_RENEWAL: {
    definition: 'Active practices for restoring energy between efforts. The counterpart to energy expenditure that enables sustained performance.',
    keyInsight: 'Rest is not the absence of work — it is an active skill. Strategic renewal between efforts produces more output than continuous effort.',
    howItWorks: 'Ultradian rhythms cycle every 90-120 minutes. Short breaks between cycles maintain quality. Different types of rest restore different types of energy.',
    keyRisks: 'Powering through without breaks, passive scrolling instead of active rest, guilt about resting, not matching rest type to depletion type.',
    practicalApplication: 'Take a 10-15 minute break every 90 minutes. Walk, breathe, or nap — do not scroll. Match rest to what was depleted (physical rest for physical work, social rest for social drain).',
  },
  ENERGY_AUDIT: {
    definition: 'Systematic tracking and measurement of energy patterns. The data foundation for optimising energy management.',
    keyInsight: 'You cannot manage what you do not measure. Most people have no idea when their energy peaks, what drains them, or what restores them. A simple audit reveals the pattern.',
    howItWorks: 'Rate energy 1-10 at regular intervals. Note activities, food, sleep, and interactions. After 1-2 weeks, patterns emerge that guide optimisation.',
    keyRisks: 'Over-tracking creating its own burden, not acting on the data, tracking without changing behaviour.',
    practicalApplication: 'Rate energy 3x daily (morning, afternoon, evening) for 2 weeks. Note the activity before each rating. Identify your top 3 energy builders and top 3 drains.',
  },
  SOCIAL_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'Energy derived from and expended in social interactions. Relationships, community, and connection as energy sources and drains.',
    keyInsight: 'People are either energy sources or energy drains. The quality of your social environment directly affects your capacity. Solitude and connection both have restorative power when chosen intentionally.',
    howItWorks: 'Introverts recharge alone and expend energy in social settings. Extroverts recharge in connection and expend energy in isolation. Most people are ambiverts — both matter. Energy contagion means others affect your state.',
    keyRisks: 'Toxic relationships that drain without reciprocity, over-socialising when depleted, isolation when connection would help, confusing obligation with genuine connection.',
    practicalApplication: 'Audit relationships for net energy impact. Schedule social recharging with energising people. Protect solitude when you need restoration. Set boundaries with energy drains.',
  },
  RESTORATIVE_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'Active practices that rebuild depleted energy. Recovery, rest, and downtime as intentional skills rather than absence of work.',
    keyInsight: 'Rest is not the absence of work — it is active restoration. Strategic recovery produces more output than continuous effort. Different depletion requires different restoration.',
    howItWorks: 'Ultradian rhythms cycle every 90-120 minutes. Physical depletion needs physical rest. Mental depletion needs mental rest (not scrolling). Emotional depletion often needs social connection or solitude. Matching rest type to depletion type accelerates recovery.',
    keyRisks: 'Passive scrolling mistaken for rest, guilt about resting, powering through without breaks, using stimulants to mask the need for recovery.',
    practicalApplication: 'Take 10-15 minute breaks every 90 minutes. Match rest type to what was depleted. Schedule recovery before you need it. Track what actually restores you.',
  },
  ACTIVE_REST: {
    definition: 'Intentional recovery activities that restore energy, as opposed to passive consumption (e.g. scrolling) that often drains it.',
    keyInsight: 'Active rest matches the type of depletion: physical rest (walk, stretch, nap), mental rest (quiet, nature, no screens), emotional rest (connection or solitude). Passive consumption is not rest.',
    howItWorks: 'Choose rest that contrasts with what you depleted. After focus work: movement or nature. After meetings: solitude. After physical effort: true rest or sleep. The wrong type of rest leaves you still depleted.',
    keyRisks: 'Scrolling or TV labelled as rest, guilt preventing real recovery, same environment for work and rest so the brain never disengages.',
    practicalApplication: 'Define 2–3 active rest options per depletion type. Schedule short recovery blocks. Turn off notifications during rest. Track which activities actually restore you.',
  },
  SLEEP_HYGIENE: {
    definition: 'Environment and habits that support quality sleep and full restoration of base energy.',
    keyInsight: 'Sleep is the primary energy restoration mechanism. Hygiene (light, temperature, timing, wind-down) matters as much as duration. Small habit changes compound.',
    howItWorks: 'Circadian rhythm responds to light and consistency. Cool, dark room; consistent schedule; no caffeine late; wind-down routine signal the brain to restore. Poor hygiene fragments sleep and reduces restoration.',
    keyRisks: 'Blue light before bed, irregular sleep times, caffeine after noon, hot or bright room, screens in bed.',
    practicalApplication: 'Same wake time every day. Dark, cool bedroom. No screens 1 hour before bed. Caffeine before noon only. Create a short wind-down routine.',
  },
  MICRO_RECOVERY: {
    definition: 'Short, intentional breaks that prevent energy collapse and protect sustained performance.',
    keyInsight: 'Brief recovery within the day prevents deep depletion. A few minutes of the right rest can reset focus and delay fatigue more than pushing through.',
    howItWorks: 'Ultradian cycles suggest a break every 90–120 minutes. Stand, walk, close eyes, breathe, or hydrate. Micro-recovery reduces cumulative drain and avoids the crash that requires long recovery.',
    keyRisks: 'No breaks until exhausted, treating breaks as unproductive, skipping breaks to hit deadlines and then burning out.',
    practicalApplication: 'Set a 90-minute work block then 5–10 minute break. Use breaks for movement or quiet, not more screens. Protect at least one micro-recovery per morning and afternoon.',

  ENVIRONMENTAL_ENERGY: {
    definition: 'How physical surroundings — light, space, and nature — affect energy levels, focus, and restoration.',
    keyInsight: 'Your environment is a passive energy manager. Most people ignore it and wonder why they feel drained. Small changes to light, clutter, and green exposure yield outsized energy returns.',
    howItWorks: 'Bright light in the morning sets circadian rhythm. Natural light reduces eye strain and improves mood. Cluttered spaces increase cognitive load. Nature exposure (even views) lowers cortisol and restores attention. Your surroundings operate on you constantly.',
    keyRisks: 'Poor lighting especially in winter, cluttered workspace, no access to nature or daylight, noisy or chaotic environments.',
    practicalApplication: 'Get bright light within 30 minutes of waking. Declutter your primary workspace. Add plants or a window view. Take walking meetings or outdoor breaks.',
