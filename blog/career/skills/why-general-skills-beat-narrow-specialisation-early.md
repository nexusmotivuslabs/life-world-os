Early in a tech career, specialisation feels like clarity.

In reality, it is often premature commitment.

The highest paid, most resilient engineers did not start narrow.
They built **transferable foundations first**, then specialised deliberately.

This is why.

## 1. What General Skills Look Like in Software Engineering

General skills are not vague. They are cross-contextual.

Examples:

* Breaking ambiguous problems into clear steps
* Reading unfamiliar codebases quickly
* Debugging systematically
* Designing for change
* Communicating technical tradeoffs clearly
* Estimating effort with increasing accuracy

These skills travel across:

* Languages
* Frameworks
* Companies
* Domains

They survive layoffs, re-orgs, and tech cycles.

## 2. What Narrow Specialisation Looks Like Too Early

Early narrow specialisation often looks impressive but fragile.

Examples:

* Deep expertise in one internal framework
* Tool mastery without understanding why it exists
* Domain knowledge without system-level understanding

These engineers are:

* Very productive in one environment
* Very slow outside it

That is not leverage. That is dependency.

## 3. Case Study: Two Early-Career Engineers

Engineer A:

* Learns core language concepts
* Studies system design
* Practices debugging and testing
* Writes clear design docs

Engineer B:

* Masters a single stack deeply
* Knows every edge case of one platform
* Avoids unfamiliar systems

Five years later:

* Engineer A moves between teams and companies easily
* Engineer B is valuable only where the context already exists

Specialisation multiplies value only after foundations are stable.

## 4. When Specialisation Actually Makes Sense

Specialise when:

* You understand multiple paths
* You see asymmetric upside
* You can explain tradeoffs, not just tools
* You can exit if needed

Good specialisation is a choice.
Bad specialisation is inertia.

---

## 5. How This Applies to Tech Roles Beyond Engineering

This applies equally to:

* Product managers
* Data scientists
* DevOps engineers
* Tech leads
* Architects

General skills create optionality.
Optionality creates negotiating power.

Titles do not.

---

## Closing Thought

Early careers should optimise for learning velocity, not surface expertise.

Build foundations first.
Specialise later.
Let compounding work in your favour.

In Life World OS, skills are persistent stats.
Tools are temporary equipment.

Choose accordingly.
